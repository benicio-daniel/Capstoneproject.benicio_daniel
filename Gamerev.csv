Wii Sport;1;Your non-gamer friends will be dazzled by the immediately intuitive controls and the imported Miis. But the title sacrifices incredible depth and visuals for an immediately accessible experience.;0;IGN;75
Wii Sport;2;The bottom line, really, is that Wii Sports, as a multiplayer game, is downright fun. Whether your thing is tennis, baseball, golf, bowling or boxing, you’re bound to be smiling - at least for a few seconds - while playing Wii Sports.;0;Kombo;75
Wii Sport;3;It's a game you can play with your friends and family, and it perfectly highlights the direction that Nintendo is taking with the platform. It's not the best-looking game on the system, and it's definitely not the deepest, but it may well be the most fun.;0;Gamespy;80
Wii Sport;4;We can't help but enjoy the fact that we're getting a solid sports experience for nothing. It's definitely more fun in groups and won't have a great deal of longevity, but anyone who doesn't find at least some fun in Wii Sports has a heart of coal.;0;GamesPro;85
Wii Sport;5;This is a simple game about simple fun, and everyone owes it to themselves to try it out to get a taste for what the Wii may in fact have in store for us all very soon.;0;eToychest;80
Wii Sport;6;A couple of the games are rewarding for the long term, but most can be easily whipped into submission in a matter of hours. The visuals are also severely lacking.;0;GamesTrailer;80
Wii Sport;7;If I had to pay for them, I probably wouldn't, but as a freebie included with the system, they're great for showcasing the system's capabilities and give all of the people in your household a chance to game — even those with no previous experience!;0;Deeko;75
Wii Sport;8;Create your Mii and challenge your friends (both gaming and non-gaming) to a game of bowling. I guarantee they’ll be hooked and so will you.;0;GamingAge;75
Wii Sport;9;Wii Sports certainly won't be hailed as the most realistic sports sim on the market, but it's the best thing - next to a bottle of tequila - to take to a friend's holiday house party.;0;GameDaily;80
Wii Sport;10;Wii Sports makes for an ideal pack-in with Nintendo's new console, providing some fun, simple gameplay that's accessible to almost anyone.;0;GameSpot;78
